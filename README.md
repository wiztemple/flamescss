# flamescss :fire: :fire: :fire:
A mini-sized css framework/boilerplate. It's made for developers who need more control of css styles without the burden or hidden impediments of a regular css framework. The flexibility that comes with `flames.css` is near perfect. You can pick what you need, either the `layout styles` or `the navbar styles` and use it. You don't need to leave it as `flames.css`, you can rename it to `styles.css`, just modify it however you like, it's all abouy you :boy: :girl: .
